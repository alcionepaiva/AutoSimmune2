# AutoSimmune2
The importance of studying the immune system comes mainly from its fundamental function in the maintenance of human life and its health. In order to help elucidating such a complex process, computational models for the immune system are applied by researchers to verify important hypotheses in a much cheaper and faster way when compared to in-vivo investigation. This project is a simulation model of the immune system that uses a multi-agent approach and seeks to broaden the level of detail of previous related works. The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a simulator of the human immune system, particularly to investigate autoimmune diseases that can be useful for teaching and for enhancing knowledge about the behavior of this intricate biological process.
